# Daily Development Log - 2026-01-29

## Summary
Successfully achieved a stable, production-ready release (v7.50) of the Fuzzy Logic EA with a highly interactive GUI.

## Key Achievements
1.  **Fuzzy Logic Engine:**
    *   Implemented core classes (`Set`, `Variable`, `Rule`, `System`) using native arrays.
    *   Removed `CArrayObj` dependency for portable compilation.
    *   Implemented 4 confirmed "Trend Reversal" rules.

2.  **Advanced GUI (Dashboard):**
    *   Migrated from simple Radio Buttons to **Custom Dropdowns**.
    *   Implemented **Overlay/Occlusion** logic for menus.
    *   Added **Drag & Drop** with Anti-Scroll protection.
    *   Implemented **Minimize/Collapse** functionality.
    *   Applied **Light Theme** (Black Text on Light Green).

3.  **DevOps & stability:**
    *   Created `build.ps1` for automated CLI compilation.
    *   Solved persistent `undeclared identifier` issues by switching UI objects from Pointers to Static Members.
    *   Established "Zero Assumption" protocol for rules.

## Next Steps
*   **Part 1a (Trend):** Implement logic to read real MA and ADX indicators.
*   **Part 2 (Decision):** Combine Trend and Reversal outputs to signal BUY/SELL.
